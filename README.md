PebbleCam
=========

A silly hack that lets you use your Pebble smart watch as a remote shutter for your iPhone's camera.

The app works by playing a blank mp3 file in the background on iOS. This lets us tap into Pebble's remote
control events (play/pause buttons). When play/pause is pressed, the app snaps a photo. Simple, eh?

Here's a YouTube video of the app in action...
